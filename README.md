👋 Hi there, I'm @xsini92 

🏢 I studied Chemistry but ended up to be an IT Healthcare Consultant. Life's jokes! 😂

⚙️ In my job, I do various stuff like:
  - 2nd level Helpdesk
  - Project Delivery
  - User Requirements analist/definer
  - Knowledge Base keeper

✍️ In my free time, I create scripts both in Linux and Windows, develop small Android apps and little Java softwares, mostly for fun or to help myself in my job.

📖 Everything I know about this world I learned for the most part by myself, so I've not a "scholar base", but I'm not that bad!

✨ I like challanges and I try to learn everyday something new, growing and improving my skills.
