👋 Hi there, I'm @xsini92 

🏢 I studied Chemistry but ended up to be an IT Healthcare Consultant. Life's jokes! 😂

✍️ I create scripts both in Linux and Windows, develop small Android apps and little Java software, mostly for fun or to help myself in my job.

📖 Everything I know about this world I learned for the most part by myself, so I've not a "scholar base", but I'm not that bad!

✨ I like challanges and I try to learn everyday something new, growing and improving my skills.
